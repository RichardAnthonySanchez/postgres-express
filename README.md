# Node.js + PostgreSQL (Odin Project Lesson)

This project follows [The Odin Project’s _Using PostgreSQL_ lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-using-postgresql). It’s a small Node.js/Express app that connects to a PostgreSQL database and shows how to:

- Set up a database and table
- Connect Node.js to PostgreSQL using the `pg` library
- Run queries from within your app
- Seed data into the database

## Why this lesson matters

Databases are a core part of almost every application. This lesson shows how to move from in-memory or file-based storage into using a **real relational database**. It’s the first step in learning how to persist data across sessions, build scalable apps, and prepare for more advanced backend concepts like migrations, ORMs, and deployment.

## Where this lesson fits

This lesson comes after setting up a basic Express server and before moving on to more advanced database tools and full-stack projects. It bridges the gap between writing server code and working with production-ready databases.
